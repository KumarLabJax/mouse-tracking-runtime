## Uses

<!-- This section addresses questions around how the model is intended to be used in different applied contexts, discusses the foreseeable users of the model (including those affected by the model), and describes uses that are considered out of scope or misuse of the model. Note this section is not intended to include the license usage details. For that, link directly to the license. -->

### Direct Use

<!-- Explain how the model can be used without fine-tuning, post-processing, or plugging into a pipeline. An example code snippet is recommended. -->

{{ direct_use | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}

### Downstream Use [optional]

<!-- Explain how this model can be used when fine-tuned for a task or when plugged into a larger ecosystem or app. An example code snippet is recommended. -->

{{ downstream_use | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}

### Out-of-Scope Use

<!-- List how the model may foreseeably be misused (used in a way it will not work for) and address what users ought not do with the model. -->

{{ out_of_scope_use | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

<!-- This section identifies foreseeable harms, misunderstandings, and technical and sociotechnical limitations. It also provides information on warnings and potential mitigations. Bias, risks, and limitations can sometimes be inseparable/refer to the same issues. Generally, bias and risks are sociotechnical, while limitations are technical: -->
<!-- A bias is a stereotype or disproportionate performance (skew) for some subpopulations. -->
<!-- A risk is a socially relevant issue that the might cause. -->
<!-- A limitation is a likely feature failure model that can be addressed following the listed Recommendations. -->

{{ bias_risks_limitations | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}

### Recommendations

<!-- This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations. -->

{{ bias_recommendations | default("Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations.", true)}}

## How to Get Started with the Model

Use the code below to get started with the model.

{{ get_started_code | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}

## Training Details

<!-- This section provides information to describe and replicate training, including the training data, the speed and size of training elements, and the environmental impact of training. This relates heavily to the Technical Specifications as well, and content here should link to that section when it is relevant to the training procedure. It is useful for people who want to learn more about the model inputs and training footprint. It is relevant for anyone who wants to know the basics of what the model is learning. -->

### Training Data

<!-- This should link to a Dataset Card, perhaps with a short stub of information on what the training data is all about as well as documentation related to data pre-processing or additional filtering. -->

{{ training_data | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}

### Training Procedure

<!-- This relates heavily to the Technical Specifications. Content here should link to that section when it is relevant to the training procedure. -->

#### Preprocessing [optional]

<!-- Detail tokenization, resizing/rewriting (depending on the modality), etc. -->

{{ preprocessing | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}


#### Training Hyperparameters

- **Training regime:** {{ training_regime | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}} <!--fp32, fp16 mixed precision, bf16 mixed precision, bf16 non-mixed precision, fp16 non-mixed precision, fp8 mixed precision -->

#### Speeds, Sizes, Times [optional]

<!-- This section provides information about throughput, start/end time, checkpoint size if relevant, etc. -->

{{ speeds_sizes_times | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}

## Evaluation

<!-- This section describes the evaluation protocols, what is being measured in the evaluation, and provides the results. Evaluation is ideally constructed with factors, such as domain and demographic subgroup, and metrics, such as accuracy, which are prioritized in light of foreseeable error contexts and groups. Target fairness metrics should be decided based on which errors are more likely to be problematic in light of the model use. You can also specify your modelâ€™s evaluation results in a structured way in the model card metadata. -->

### Testing Data, Factors & Metrics

#### Testing Data

<!-- This should link to a Dataset Card if possible. -->

{{ testing_data | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}

#### Factors

<!-- These are the things the evaluation is disaggregating by, e.g., subpopulations or domains. -->

{{ testing_factors | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}

#### Metrics
